In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:
The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

Task
Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.
Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.

Solution:

def is_leap(year):
    leap = False
    
    if (year % 400 == 0):
        return True
    if (year % 100 == 0):
        return leap
    if (year % 4 == 0):
        return True
    else:
        return False 
    
    return leap

year = int(input())
print(is_leap(year))
